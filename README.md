## Project background
WHO’s Global Health Estimates (GHE) present comprehensive and comparable time-series data from 2000 onwards for health-related indicators, including life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, mortality and morbidity, as well as burden of diseases at global, regional and country levels, disaggregated by age, sex and cause1.<br>

The estimates are produced using data from multiple consolidated sources, including national vital registration data, latest estimates from its technical programmes, United Nations partners and inter-agency groups, and other scientific studies. A broad spectrum of robust and well-established scientific methods is applied for the processing, synthesis, and analysis of data¹.
WHO’s Global Health Estimates (GHE) provide the latest available data on death and disability globally and geographically disaggregated by WHO regions and countries. The latest updates include global, regional, and country trends estimates from 2000 to 2019.<br>

## Broad goal of analyses
The purpose of this project is to produce an in-depth analysis using the GHE (2000-2019) trend-series presenting results on health-related indicators disaggregated by age, sex, and cause. The analysis should consider the different subregions and focus on changes over time. The idea is to produce one technical report, and two peer-reviewed articles from this work. Potential outlines are presented below.

### 1. Technical Document - potential outline
We plan to have 4 chapters, at a total length of between 30 and 40 pages. Chapters broadly might have the following structure.

#### General questions
<mark>Q1. Always use full available time-range for change?</mark>
<mark>Q2. To what extent should we expand analytics to additional data resources (which may of course have a range of different biases?</mark>
<mark>Q3. WHO has no sub-region classification. Use UN M49 categorization instead? Follow-up - several "Caribbean" nations than fall out of a Caribbean definition (Belize, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana). Tweak UN classification?</mark>
<mark>Q4. If using WHO life table estimates (a) Only results for select yrs via GHO and (b) no sub-regional aggregation of LE estimates.

#### Chapter 1: Regional Overview
_Initial Brief_: The leading causes of deaths and disabilities and the changes over time (should include analysis on inequities and demographic/epidemiological transition). This chapter should also present results for the three main broad group of causes of deaths and disabilities: communicable (infectious diseases, along with maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions), noncommunicable diseases (including mental health) and external causes.

_Outline_: 
A. LIFE EXPECTANCY GAINS BETWEEN 2000 AND 2019
    - by subregion
    - by income classification
    - by sex

> TYPE:   Vertical bubbles. 
> USE:    Highlights LE range within each stratification group
> PANELS: One chart per year 
> X-AXIS: Country/sex stratifications) 
> Y-AXIS: Life Expectancy point estimate)
> **Metrics Available**
> LE by country 
> **Metrics Not Available**
> LE by region (aggregated) 
> LE by sub-region


B. BROAD CAUSES OF DEATH
Present the changes between 2000 and 2019, for THREE broad categories:
    - infectious disease, maternal, perinatal, nutritional
    - noncommuunicable diseases
    - external causes
 

#### Chapter 2: NCDs and deaths from external causes
_Initial Brief_: NCDs (including mental health) and external causes: two preventable killers
(including the dangerous combination of COVID-19 and NCDs and the impact of COVID-19 on the increase of violence).

_Outline_: 


#### Chapter 3: Saving lives and Improving quality of health
_Initial Brief_: Saving lives and improving quality of health: implementing policies and programs and strengthening the health care system response (including an assessment on losses and gains over time)

_Outline_:

### 2. Peer-reviewed article A: GHEs with focus on NCDs (incl. mental health)
_Initial Brief_: Scientific manuscript to be published in a high impact journal – using the GHE (2000-2019) trend-series to conduct a more in-depth analysis for the Americas on NCDs including mental health. The consultant will submit a proposed outline and an analysis plan for review and comments.

_Initial Brief_: Scientific manuscript to be published in a high impact journal - using the GHE (2000-2019) trend-series to conduct a more in-depth analysis for the Americas on external causes. The consultant will submit a proposed outline and an analysis plan for review and comments.
